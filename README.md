The repository contains some applications of algorithm and data structures in real life, exposed in a didactical view: it could be largely useful (I hope) for people who are studying P-NP classes problems, efficient implementations of memory management, complexity of time, etc..

Format of net_example_file.txt : the file is composed by sequences of 3 lines.
First of the three ones is a vertex of the net followed by a ":". The second one contains the adjacent vertices (since the net is oriented, the adjacent vertices are pointed by the first) and the weight of their arcs in this mode : 
vertexA:
firstAdjacent:weightOfTheArcWithTheFirstAdjacent:secondAdjacent:etc....

The third line is blank.

In priorityQueue, you can modify the inner class making redBlack taking it over (so try it as an exercise); remember to change some method's name and to verify compatibility in inheritance. Notice that redBlack needs including of redBlackNode (so include it in your libraries).
